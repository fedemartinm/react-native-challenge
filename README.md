# Full Stack Coding Challenge

Develop a dog breed wish list

## Functional Requirements
- Create an autocomplete text field that suggests dog breeds from a database as you type (you can find the initial list of dog breeds in `dog-breeds.csv`).
- If a dog breed which the user entered does not exist yet in the database, it will need to be created in the database.
- When the user selects or enters a dog breed, it will need to be added to the wish list of dog breeds of the user.
- The wish list of the user needs to be shown on the same page and updated in real time.
- The user needs to be able to delete a dog breed from their wish list.
- It's not required to persist the user's wishlist to the database (it's optional and up to you).

## Technical Requirements
- The frontend needs to be written in a modern JS framework (no jQuery or plain JS)
- The backend needs to be written in a modern PHP framework and use a MySQL database
- The frontend needs to be able to communicate with the backend through a RESTful API
- The frontend needs to be compatible with all major browsers and desktop/mobile/tablet screen sizes.
- The frontend should be dynamic and update in real time without reloading the page
- The autocomplete js component needs to be built from scratch and not using an existing or 3rd party library
- The component (frontend and backend) needs to be a generic autocomplete such that the dataset is configurable and can be used for more than just dog breeds

## Evaluation Criteria
- You care about design and the user experience.
- You create elegant, clean and maintainable code.
- You develop in a way that has clearly defined areas of responsibility.
- You pay attention to details.
- You are able to consider edge cases.
- You care about performance and scalability.

## Submission

- Push the code to an online repository and send us the link.
- The web page + backend needs to live online so we can test it (we recommend to use Heroku)
